          <p>
          While habitat loss, poor land use and conflict with humans pose pressures to wild tiger populations, <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">poaching and illegal trade</span> have been the primary cause for their decline.
            <br>
            <br>
          Every year, illegal wildlife trade amounts to $20 billion worth of animal parts, and is the <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">third most profitable trade</span> on the black market.
          Tigers are mercilessly targeted by poachers to satisfy the demand from the trade.

            <p style=" font-size: 18px;">With India containing the largest wild tiger population globally,

              here are funneled into China due to high demands.</p>

        <p>
        Over the years, the demand for tigers has led to the <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">mass development of inhumane tiger breeding farms,</span> where tigers are actively bred,
        slaughtered and traded under undesirable conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        From 2005 to 2019, the percentage of whole tigers seized from captive-bred sources increased from <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">9% to over 50%,</span> with a minimum of <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">744

            Tiger reserves play a significant part in Thailand's massive tourism industry. However, over the years there have been increasing
            reports of these reserves being irresponsibly run. Much of these reserves were reported to be farming tigers for unethical
            wildlife entertainment and illegal trading purposes.

              <p>One such reserve is the Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua Yanasampanno Temple. For years, the temple has been
                a popular tourist hotspot where tourists could see tigers and monks living together in harmony.
                However, there have been allegations about the temple sedating their tigers and being involved in illegal wildlife trades.

                <br>
                In 2016, Thai officers raided the temple and seized a total of 60 dead cubs, amongst a plethora of

        <p>
        Despite institutional efforts over the years to combat animal related crimes, policies still fall short in certain countries.
        <br>
        <br>
        These countries have <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">disproportionately low commercial penalties</span> for illegal wildlife trade. Due to the commercial nature of such crimes,
         active and potential poachers are massively incentivised to continue hunting.
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with weak criminal response, endangered animal products <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">continue to run rampant in black markets.</span>

        Vietnam is a striking example of this. Vietnam only

        <br>
        <br>
        The differences in these numbers are indicative of weak criminal responses within the country.

            <p>Another case in point is the ongoing manufacturing of Tiger bone wine in China. Sanhong is a Chinese based company that manufactures tiger bone wine.
              They specifically market their products to contain real tiger bones. In 2012, an investigation was launched to study the company and Chinese policies on endangered

              <br>
              It was found that Chinese policies <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">permitted the use of tiger bones from captive based animals</span> within the country.
              Sanhong was also found to be <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 700;">operating under legal permissions from the government</span> to use tiger bones in their products as long as they did not list

        <h1 style="color: white;">How can we <mark>help?</mark></h1>

        <p>While it is very much apparent that a significant part of conserving current wild tiger populations relies
          on solving multiple institutional issues, there is still a lot we can do individually. It is not too late.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to Panthera, a recent report has shown that global populations have stabilized in the past years due to improved investments in tiger conservation. Wild tiger populations have since increased by 40% from 2010
        to 2022. Last year's count stood at approximately 4500. 
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p style="color: white; font-weight: 900;">We can help keep the numbers up by:</p>

          <p style="color: orange; font-weight: 900;">
            Engaging in responsible tourism and consumption  </p>

          <p style=" font-size: 18px;"> Demands are the reason why unethical wildlife entertainment and goods exist. Change starts from within.
            By being responsible in the places you visit and the products you consume, you can help to reduce demands for animal commodities.

            </p>

          <p style="color: orange; font-weight: 900;">
            It doesn't stop at consumerism. Be vocal about the need for change. </p>

          <p style=" font-size: 18px;">
            Intervene, educate, and raise awareness. Every individual enlightened is a step towards the right direction.
            Sign petitions to urge governments to reevaluate their legislation on animal related crimes.
